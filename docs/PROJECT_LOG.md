# Project Log

This is an append-only operational log. Never delete or rewrite accepted entries. Corrections must be added as new entries that reference the original entry.

## Required entry fields

Each new entry must record: UTC timestamp, actor, task/phase, base branch and SHA, working branch, PR number/URL, commit SHA, exact changed files, test command, GitHub Actions run URL/result, artifact or release URL, acceptance status, reviewer, remaining risks, and next action. Unknown evidence must be written as `NOT_VERIFIED`, never guessed.

### [2026-08-24] Phase 2B Replacement Candidate (PR #12)
- Recorded PR #10 governance merge in PROJECT_STATUS.md.
- Created and recorded PR #12 as the replacement candidate for Phase 2B, superseding PR #9.
- Current active branch: `codex/phase-2b-source-registration-12955190277775369594`
- Base SHA: `a41b07d7a7dd192c3ae4a277eb4903327883456f`
- Verified CI evidence: GitHub Backend CI run #16 successful on PR #12.
- Updated docs to ensure Phase 2B metadata-registration conflict rejection is thoroughly tested and verified.

### 2026-08-24T08:00:00Z — PR #12 corrective evidence and documentation finalization

- Actor: Jules implementation; ChatGPT/Codex independent remote verification and documentation correction
- Task/phase: Phase 2B ingestion foundation replacement candidate
- Base: `source-data-cleanup@a41b07d7a7dd192c3ae4a277eb4903327883456f`
- Working branch: `codex/phase-2b-source-registration-12955190277775369594`
- PR: [#12](https://github.com/davoodmehraban89/Aram/pull/12)
- Independently reviewed implementation head: `9e90533658e400a51402db673efae9cbd0aa37d1`
- Changed files at reviewed head: `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `backend/README.md`, `backend/pyproject.toml`, `backend/src/aram_backend/ingestion.py`, `backend/src/aram_backend/ledger_parser.py`, `backend/src/aram_backend/workbook_inspection.py`, `backend/tests/test_ingestion.py`, `backend/tests/test_ledger_parser.py`, `backend/tests/test_workbook_inspection.py`, `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md`, `docs/handoff/LATEST_HANDOFF.md`
- Regression evidence: exact duplicate remains idempotent; same-year/same-hash conflicts in document type, filename, or both raise `SourceRegistrationError`; each rejection leaves one unchanged original `SourceDocument`
- Reported local verification by Jules: full backend pytest suite, compileall, Alembic upgrade/downgrade round-trip, and `git diff --check` passed; exact pytest count was not independently captured and remains `NOT_VERIFIED`
- GitHub Actions: [Backend CI run #17](https://github.com/davoodmehraban89/Aram/actions/runs/32703999006), `success`
- Artifacts/releases: none
- Protected data: the complete PR filename list contains no canonical XLSX/PDF, `data/`, database, ZIP, EXE, or financial-source file
- Acceptance: `IN_PROGRESS`; Draft and unmerged
- Reviewer: ChatGPT/Codex candidate-requirements review; final acceptance pending
- Remaining risks: final documentation commits require their own CI result; independent acceptance decision is not yet recorded
- Recovery: close PR #12 without merging to leave the accepted branch unchanged
- Next action: independently review the final remote head and record an explicit decision
